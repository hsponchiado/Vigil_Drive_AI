#  VigilDrive AI

**AI‑Powered Driver Fatigue Detection & Governance Platform**

VigilDrive AI is a real‑time driver safety system that uses computer vision to detect early signs of driver fatigue (eye closure, reduced blinking, PERCLOS) and trigger escalating alerts — all while emphasizing **privacy by design** and **responsible AI**, aligned with the **IBM Track**.

This project was built for a hackathon by a team of 3 and is designed to be demo friendly, modular, and enterprise ready.

##  Problem Statement

Drowsy driving causes thousands of accidents every year. Existing solutions are often reactive or intrusive. VigilDrive AI provides a **proactive**, **privacy‑aware**, and **explainable AI** system that detects fatigue *before* it becomes dangerous.

---

##  Key Features

###  Real‑Time AI Detection

* Webcam‑based driver monitoring
* Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
* **PERCLOS** (Percentage of Eye Closure)
* Fatigue classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

###  Smart Alert System

* Escalating alerts based on fatigue level
* Audio alerts (cross‑platform)
* Alert logging with timestamps

###  Analytics Dashboard

* Fatigue timeline visualization
* Alert frequency analysis
* Historical trend tracking

###  Privacy & Governance (IBM Track)

* On‑device processing (no cloud video storage)
* Optional face blurring
* Audit logging
* Model transparency & limitations

## Installation & Setup

### 1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsponchiado/Vigil_Drive_AI.git
cd Vigildrive-ai
```

### 2 Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3 Upgrade pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

##  Testing Alerts (Optional)

To test the alert system without the camera:

```bash
python test_person_b.py
```

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11**
* **Streamlit** — Web UI
* **OpenCV** — Computer vision
* **NumPy / Pandas** — Data processing
* **SQLite** — Local logging
* **Matplotlib** — Analytics charts
* **Playsound** — Cross‑platform alerts

---

##  Responsible AI & IBM Track Alignment

* Privacy‑by‑design (local processing)
* No facial data stored
* Explainable fatigue metrics (EAR, PERCLOS)
* Transparent limitations documented
* Governance & audit logs

---


##  Demo Tips

* Start with eyes open → normal state
* Close eyes for 2–3 seconds → trigger HIGH alert
* Show analytics dashboard after demo
* Highlight privacy features for IBM judges

---

##  Future Improvements

* Mobile deployment
* Fleet management dashboard
* ML‑based fatigue classifier
* Voice alerts & haptic feedback
